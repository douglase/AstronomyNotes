## Cosmic Context - Time
- starting **Activity** 3 minutes? Heart beat exercise, have
	everyone feel the number beats that correspond to the same
	fraction of their time on earth as a their time on earth is a
	fraction of the age of the universe. 2 beats for every 15 year old -- so if you're 90, count to 12.
- What: 13 billion year old universe


	
## Cosmic Context - What we don't know about our place
- Why don't we know if we are alone? Where are the pictures of other
planets? **Print of Earth from Apollo photo**
- Size of sun
- **Activity** (5 min) walk from the sun to the earth, given size of earth relative to sun (1/100)
- solar system context - stars with known planets - still working on
the census. *lookup latest discovered planet number on 20
Oct*. (xkcd.com Exoplanets illustration:)
- Distance to another star _(Boston USA to Quito Chile works for a soccer-ball sized sun to proxima centauri)_
- so, why have we discovered some planets?
-  5 minutes on planets we know about.
   - only in the past few years have we started to have a census of
     planets, by searching hundreds of thousands of stars for planets
     passing in front of stars
	- what our imagination sees - print of Trappist-1 poster 
	- what do we know **use basketball or yellow soccer ball to show how a transit works**: (https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/system/downloadable_items/315_TRAPPIST-1e_PRINT_E.jpg):
	- print of Venus

what can we learn by finding these planets?
	- how to planets form
	- how to atmosphere's work
	
- **Activity** 4 minutes. Ask your neighbor, If we discover life on
another world, would your life change? How?

These are two of the nearest star systems we know about,
but we know very little about them. And our census of nearby stars is
incomplete, so we don't know if there are other nearer stars that have
Earthlike planets. 

Concluding activity: *2 min* Imaging firefly in the midwest. imagine a pair of binoculars
large enough to see it from Maine (about as big as a 30 ft
sailboat). Now imagine a spotlight a yard from the firefly, pointed
back at you. Replace the firefly with a minauture planet and try to
discern if it has life...
- finding earth around another star is like looking down the chicago world's fair spotlight and seeing a firefly  next to it - in Chicago, from the East Coast.

## Why: Universe is expanding

- How do we know that, and who?:
		- Explain standard candles and show the data
		- stars in the sky have different brightnesses but some produce the
		  same amount of light regardless of their distance, oscillating
		stars and collapsing white dwarves
		- drawing to show a candle of fixed brightness 2x further away
          is 1/4 as bright (mention smartphone flashes are the modern candle)
		- Print of Hubble's Andromedae plate that established Milky
          Way is one of many Galaxies.
		-  Distance isn't enough to determine the age, how do we know
           they moving away from us?
		- We see that galaxies are moving away from by looking at the
        color of light - draw a spectrum?
		- Show how the precision of measurement has increased over time,
		converging on the age of the universe
